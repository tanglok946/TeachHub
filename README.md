## ❌ Problem Statement

Traditional tutoring services come with several challenges for students:

- **Expensive 💸** — Private tutors often charge high fees.  
- **Inconvenient ⏳** — Requires traveling to physical locations, wasting time.  
- **Low Engagement 😴** — Often passive, with the tutor talking and the student just listening.    

These problems make learning less effective and less motivating for today’s digital-native students.
